# Description

## Thought it was weird that you couldn't paste text from your clipboard into the game, so I made this. Doesn't support emojis or anything fancy, but it should work for most text. Press Ctrl+V to paste text from your clipboard into the game


It is planned to potentially add support for emojis and other special characters in the future, but for now, we get what we get.
